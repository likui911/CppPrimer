/*
Assume that we want HasPtr to behave like a value. That is, each object should have its 
own copy of the string to which the objects point. Weâ€™ll show the definitions of the 
copy-control members in the next section. However, you already know everything you need 
to know to implement these members. Write the HasPtr copy constructor and copyassignment 
operator before reading on.
